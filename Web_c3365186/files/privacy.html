        <h3>Privacy Policy for Rewind Rentals</h3>
        <br>
        <p>- Updated October, 2022</p>
        <br>
        <p>
          This following document sets forth the Privacy Policy for the Rewind
          Rentals website, http://www.rewindrentals.com.<br>
          Rewind Rentals is committed to providing you with the best possible
          customer service experience. Rewind Rentals is bound by the Privacy
          Act 1988 (Cth), which sets out a number of principles concerning the
          privacy of individuals.
	</p>
          <br><br>
       
        <h4>Collection of your personal information</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
          There are many aspects of the site which can be viewed without
          providing personal information, however, for access to future Rewind
          Rentals customer support features you are required to submit
          personally identifiable information. This may include but not limited
          to a unique username and password, or provide sensitive information in
          the recovery of your lost password.
        </p>
        <br><br>

        <h4>Sharing of your personal information</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
          We may occasionally hire other companies to provide services on our
          behalf, including but not limited to handling customer support
          enquiries, processing transactions or customer freight shipping. Those
          companies will be permitted to obtain only the personal information
          they need to deliver the service. Rewind Rentals takes reasonable
          steps to ensure that these organisations are bound by confidentiality
          and privacy obligations in relation to the protection of your personal
          information.
        </p>
        <br><br>

          personalized content to you while you are at this Site.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          From time to time, we may use customer information for new,
          unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If
          our information practices change at some time in the future we will
          use for these new purposes only, data collected from the time of the
